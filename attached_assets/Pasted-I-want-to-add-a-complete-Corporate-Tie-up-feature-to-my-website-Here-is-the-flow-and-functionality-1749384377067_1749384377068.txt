I want to add a complete Corporate Tie-up feature to my website.

Here is the flow and functionality I need:

Corporate Tie-up Registration:

Add a section on the website where corporate owners / HR managers can register their company for a tie-up.

They should be able to fill a form with:

Company Name

Company Registration Number / GSTIN

Company Address

Contact Person Name & Contact Details

Company Email Address

Approximate number of employees

Purpose of tie-up (bulk gifting / employee offers / maintenance service / all of these)

Admin should get notified of new tie-up requests and be able to approve/reject them.

Corporate Portal:

Once approved, the corporate owner should get login access to a Corporate Portal where they can:

Place bulk orders for jewelry (for gifting, events, etc.) at special corporate discounted rates.

View and track their orders.

Download invoices.

Manage their company profile.

Employee Benefits:

Approved corporate partners should get a unique Corporate Code / Link.

Employees of these companies can use this Corporate Code to:

Get special offers/discounts on personal purchases.

Enroll for Free Jewelry Maintenance Program (cleaning, polishing, minor repairs once per year free).

Access other exclusive offers.

Free Jewelry Maintenance Feature:

If an employee uses the Corporate Code and opts for maintenance, a record should be kept in their profile.

The Admin dashboard should show:

Which employees are enrolled.

When maintenance was last done.

Allow admin to schedule and confirm maintenance.

Admin Controls:

Admin should have full control to:

Approve/reject corporate registrations.

Set corporate discount rates.

Set offers for employees of each corporate.

Track corporate orders.

Track employee participation in maintenance program.

Marketing Text:

Please also add a landing page section to promote this feature:

Suggested Heading: "Corporate Gifting & Employee Privileges Program"

Suggested text: "Partner with us to offer exclusive jewelry privileges to your employees. From bulk gifting to personal discounts and free maintenance, reward your team with the timeless gift of jewelry!"
